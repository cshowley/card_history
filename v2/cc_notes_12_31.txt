training data v3:

new data source: fanatics auctions aka "pwcc_graded_items"
new feature column in fanatics: "subset"

gemrate_pokemon_cards is outdated
ebay & fanatics sales have been filled in
	do they have missing gemrate_ids?
	i.e. have all pokemon cards had >= 1 sale?
	need that for embedding training

1. use gemrate_pokemon_cards as baseline metadata aggregation
2. pull all sales from ebay+fanatics, if any new gemrate_ids are found that are not present in gemrate_pokemon_cards then use the metadata contained in those sales to add to the embedding training preparation
3. look for identical card metadata between gemrate_pokemon_cards & the sales history tables; if a card has identical metadata but conflicting gemrate IDs then use the sales history tables as the source of truth, then update the gemrate id in embedding metadata
4. this should provide:
	a. all cards & their metadata from gemrate_pokemon_cards
	b. all cards' metadata from sales, including those not properly catalogged in gemrate_pokemon_cards
	c. corrected gemrate_ids based on sales data
		i. ID not used in embedding calculation, shouldn't be a problem
** are there any cards whose IDs change during their sales history because a gemrate_id was updated? does using universal_gemrate_id avoid this problem?
